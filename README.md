### Instructions:

- Implement the same priority queue but use a SortedList<int, Queue<T>> instead of PriorityQueue<TElement, TPriority>.

#### Define three methods:

- Insert(priority, task): Adds a task at the given priority level.
- Peek(): Returns the task with the highest priority.
- RemoveMin(): Removes and returns the highest-priority task.

#### Testing:

Add and test tasks with the same instructions as Part 1.
Comparison:

After completing both implementations, students should write a short reflection comparing the ease of use, performance, and any challenges faced with each approach.
